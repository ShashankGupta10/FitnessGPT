Having a band around the thighs forces the lower body to work harder, particularly the hips and glutes. The plank jack is commonly performed as part of a bodyweight circuit, or as part of a dynamic warm-up."
3.0,Banded crunch,"The banded crunch is an exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles. The band adds resistance and continuous tension to this popular exercise."
4.0,Crunch,"The crunch is a popular core exercise targeting the rectus abdominis, or ""six-pack"" muscles, as well as the obliques. It has been the centerpiece of many ab-focused workouts, due to both its simplicity and the intense burn and mind-muscle connection it produces.

610.0,Cross-body plank march,"The cross-body plank march is an exercise targeting the entire core but especially the obliques. It’s more difficult than a standard plank, with the extra stabilization challenge of bringing one knee at a time off the ground toward the opposing elbow. This will increase the challenge to the core and shoulder muscles, but also present a coordination and balance challenge."
611.0,Bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction,"The bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction is an advanced exercise that combines the isometric stabilization of the Copenhagen plank with dynamic adductions to challenge the core stabilizers and adductors. This exercise targets the same muscles as the side plank, including the obliques, shoulders, and lateral hips, but places extra emphasis on the adductors and is more difficult than side planks on the floor. Most lifters will need to progress to this version after mastering the basic side plank or Copenhagen plank first."

It starts in a plank-style position, with the arms resting on a ball. Then, roll the ball out in front of you as far as you can while maintaining a strong, neutral spinal position. The lack of stability from the ball increases the degree of difficulty. This is a difficult movement, and beginners may need to use a limited range of motion."
628.0,Medicine ball pass,"The medicine ball pass is a simple partner-based exercise that involves throwing a weighted ball back and forth. It can be part of a dynamic warm-up for lifting or athletics, but can also work as active rest or as a component of circuit training."

It requires—and builds—great strength in the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles, as well as the obliques and deep core muscles. If you can't perform it hanging from a bar, the lying windshield wiper on the floor provides some of the same benefits."
640.0,Exercise Ball Pull-In,The exercise ball knee roll-in is an abdominal exercise that involves supporting yourself with your hands in a plank or push-up position and drawing the knees in toward the chest. This is a fairly advanced abdominal move requiring core strength.
641.0,Exercise ball crunch,"The exercise ball crunch is a popular gym exercise targeting the abdominals. Unlike crunches on the floor or a bench, by using a ball you can increase the range of motion and both stretch and contract the abs on every rep. The ball crunch can be performed for low reps with a slower tempo focusing on a hard contraction, or for higher reps."
642.0,Feet-elevated crunch,"The feet-elevated crunch is a variation on the basic crunch, a very popular ab move. Resting the feet on a bench takes some of the hip flexor activation out of the movement, focusing the stress more on the abs. It may have a small range of motion, but this movement produces a major burn."

646.0,Exercise ball squat and twist,"The exercise ball squat and twist is a combination exercise targeting the quads, but also the obliques because of the twisting motion with each repetition. The exercise ball is held close to the chest throughout. Because it is a lightweight movement, it is usually performed for high reps or for time, and can be a great part of a bodyweight and exercise ball circuit."
647.0,Swiss Ball V-Up With Foot Pass,"The exercise ball V-up is a popular movement to target the abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles.

649.0,Exercise ball bird dog,"The exercise ball bird dog is a dynamic movement focusing on the glutes and the postural muscles of the upper back. When performing it, use an exercise ball that is tall enough to support your chest and core, but short enough to allow your hands and knees to reach the ground.

Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core, but it utilizes the biceps slightly more than overhand pull-ups. It can be used as a more shoulder-friendly alternative to straight-bar pull-ups, or to help perform more reps than you can perform overhand."
854.0,Pull-up - Gethin Variation,"The pull-up is a multi-joint bodyweight exercise that builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core.
