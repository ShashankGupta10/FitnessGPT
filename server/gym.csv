Having a band around the thighs forces the lower body to work harder, particularly the hips and glutes. The plank jack is commonly performed as part of a bodyweight circuit, or as part of a dynamic warm-up."
3.0,Banded crunch,"The banded crunch is an exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles. The band adds resistance and continuous tension to this popular exercise."
4.0,Crunch,"The crunch is a popular core exercise targeting the rectus abdominis, or ""six-pack"" muscles, as well as the obliques. It has been the centerpiece of many ab-focused workouts, due to both its simplicity and the intense burn and mind-muscle connection it produces.
